# Echo Generation
This code served as the base implementation of a much larger project now which can be found [here](https://github.com/EchoGeneration).

The goal was to be able to simulate what echos would be generated from a surface(s) given an input sound and a image of the scene in which we are in. The end goal is to use this software to help blind users learn to navigate the world using a custom device which would generate echos in their ears to simulate echolocation.
